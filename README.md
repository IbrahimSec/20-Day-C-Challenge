# 20-Day C Challenge ðŸš€

## About This Repository
This repository documents my 20-day C programming challenge to master fundamental concepts such as pointers, arrays, file I/O, linked lists, and function pointers. My goal is to prepare for the UM6P/1337 programming school by building a strong foundation in C.

## Challenge Overview
- **Duration**: 20 days
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Pointers and memory management
  - Arrays and strings
  - File I/O operations
  - Structs and dynamic memory allocation
  - Linked lists and sorting algorithms
  - Function pointers and advanced topics
- **Daily Commitment**: Complete exercises and push code daily to maintain a GitHub green streak.

## Directory Structure
- `C01`: Basics of pointers and mini-programs.
- `C02`: Strings, arrays, and manipulation exercises.
- `C03-C04`: File I/O and structs.
- `C05-C08`: Linked lists and dynamic memory allocation.
- `C09`: Function pointers and calculator implementation.
